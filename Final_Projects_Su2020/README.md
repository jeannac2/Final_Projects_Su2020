Each fork from here is a final project by one or more students in IS590PR, Summer 2020 semester.

The majority of food pantry users experience chronic illness, disability, unemployment, food insecurity and poverty. 
These conditions in turn negatively influence quality of life, in the form of consequences to social, mental, and 
physical well-being (Murali & Oyebode, 2004). Further, individuals are more likely to be overweight, a conundrum that 
has plagued researchers in food insecurity studies. However, recent investigations indicate that stress plays a 
predominant role, which is counter to the traditional thought of poor personal food choices (Simon & Ben, 2017). The 
present analysis seeks to examine the degree to which weight is influenced by the number of children in a home with 
food insecurity.

Assumptions

Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization, 1946).

Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age that shape health (World Health Organization, 2020).

Variables

Independent Randomized

LivingWithChildren: The number of people living under 18 in the respondents home

Has_Eaten_Healthy: Whether or not the respondent is eating healthy

Dependent
Weight: The weight in pounds of the respondent

Hypothesis: I hypothesize that respondents who have children will have a greater likelyhood of eating healthy and being overweight
